## Planning

### User Stories

- As a competitive user, I want to see my overall scores so I can see how much better I am getting each session

- As a laidback user, I want a simple game so that I can have a mindless time waster when I am bored.

- As a visual user, I want an interactive design so that I can enjoy the game visually

- As an older user, I want the game page to be easy to navigate so that I don't get confused while trying to play a game of Tic Tac Toe.
